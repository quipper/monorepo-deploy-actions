# open-backport-pull-request

This is an action to open Backport Pull Requests from a specific branch.

This is useful in branching strategies like Gitflow, where a hotfix to the `main` branch needs to be backported to the `develop` branch afterwards.

## Usage

To create a backport pull request when a branch is changed:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'main'
      - '*/main'

  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      headBranch:
        description: Target branch to backport from
        required: true

jobs:
  backport:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: backport
        name: Open Backport Pull Request
        uses: quipper/monorepo-deploy-actions/open-backport-pull-request@v1
        with:
          base-branch: develop
```

This action creates a working branch from the latest commit of head branch.
It creates a pull request from the working branch, because the head branch is protected typically.
When the pull request is conflicted, you can edit the working branch on GitHub.
